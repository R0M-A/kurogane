# Integration patterns for [`winit`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/)

Kurogane supports multiple event-loop integration strategies when embedding Chromium via [winit](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/). Each strategy differs in how the host process drives the [Chromium message loop](https://chromiumembedded.github.io/cef/general_usage#message-loop-integration), the mechanism by which Chromium's internal scheduler dispatches I/O completions, IPC messages and renderer tasks on the browser process's main thread.

> **Threading model.** Chromium's browser-process main thread is a cooperative, single-threaded executor. It does not use a background pump thread. The host process is responsible for calling [`CefDoMessageLoopWork`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/(_globals).html#CefDoMessageLoopWork()) frequently enough that Chromium's internal timers and I/O completions are not starved. The strategies below differ only in *when* and *how often* the host elects to call this function.

## Strategy Comparison

| Example | [`ControlFlow`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/enum.ControlFlow.html) mode | Pump cadence | Idle CPU | Complexity | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`views_poll.rs`](../tests/winit/views_poll.rs) | `Poll` | Every loop iteration | Highest | Trivial | Quick debugging / experimentation |
| [`views_timer.rs`](../tests/winit/views_timer.rs) | `WaitUntil` | Fixed 16 ms interval | Moderate | Low | Simple integrations without proxies |
| [`views_scheduler.rs`](../tests/winit/views_scheduler.rs) | `Wait` + wakeup | On Chromium's scheduler callback | Lowest | Medium | Standard production apps (Chromium Windows) |
| [`host_window.rs`](../tests/winit/host_window.rs) | `Wait` + wakeup | On Chromium's scheduler callback | Lowest | Advanced | Custom windowing / embedding into existing UI |

> **Views vs. Embedded.** The first three examples use [Chromium's Views framework](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef/tree/master/include/views), where [`CefBrowserView`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/CefBrowserView.html) owns the native window. Host-managed native window embedding example ([`host_window.rs`](../tests/winit/host_window.rs)) inverts this: the host creates the native window via [`winit`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/) and attaches Chromium as a child-window browser via [`CefWindowInfo::SetAsChild`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/CefWindowInfo.html). The event loop and window lifecycle management differs significantly between these two modes; see the native embedded integrator for details.

## Continuous polling loop _(aka the Brute-forcer)_

The minimal-viable integration. On every `winit` event-loop iteration, the host calls Kurogane's [`Runtime::pump`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/86ce9810bcfa6b3b0d2f9a87f04907be7e799829/kurogane/src/runtime.rs#L491) which in turn calls [`CefDoMessageLoopWork`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/(_globals).html#CefDoMessageLoopWork()) then immediately schedules the next iteration.

```rust
event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
    *control_flow = ControlFlow::Poll;

    match event {
        Event::MainEventsCleared => {
            handle.pump();
        }
        // ...
    }
});
```

* **Cadence:** [`ControlFlow::Poll`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/enum.ControlFlow.html#variant.Poll) executes every iteration. Kurogane is pumped continuously at an unbounded rate.
* **CPU profile:** Highest idle CPU usage. This matches the documented worst-case behavior of [`CefDoMessageLoopWork`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/(_globals).html#CefDoMessageLoopWork()).
* **Complexity:** No scheduler integration is required; Kurogane's `App::scheduler` callback is not invoked.

**Use when:** you want the minimum amount of code needed for disposable testing or debugging where performance profiling is not the objective.

## Fixed-interval timer loop _(aka the Clockwatcher)_

A fixed-interval pump using winit's [`ControlFlow::WaitUntil`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/enum.ControlFlow.html#variant.WaitUntil). The host wakes every 16 ms (~60 Hz) and calls Kurogane's [`Runtime::pump`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/86ce9810bcfa6b3b0d2f9a87f04907be7e799829/kurogane/src/runtime.rs#L491), approximating the behaviour of a naive `SetTimer`-based integration common in legacy Win32 Chromium hosts.

```rust
const PUMP_INTERVAL: Duration = Duration::from_millis(16);

event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
    *control_flow = ControlFlow::WaitUntil(Instant::now() + PUMP_INTERVAL);

    match event {
        Event::MainEventsCleared => {
            handle.pump();
        }
        // ...
    }
});
```

* **Cadence:** Driven by [`ControlFlow::WaitUntil`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/enum.ControlFlow.html#variant.WaitUntil). Chromium is pumped at a fixed interval (~60Hz / 16ms), decoupled from `winit`'s native input/window event rate.
* **CPU profile:** Low-to-moderate constant baseline overhead. The runtime wakes and pumps even when the browser state is fully quiescent.
* **Complexity:** Minimal. Bypasses [`CefApp::OnScheduleMessagePumpWork`](https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/docs/108.4/classCefBrowserProcessHandler.html#a7ff7d1618399ede096ba16486a71d76e) / Kurogane's `App::scheduler`. The host dictates the clock, not Chromium.
* **Tuning trade-off:** 16 ms is a reasonable default. Increasing the interval (e.g., 100ms) drops CPU overhead further at the cost of perceptible jank in animated content.

**Use when:** you want a simple, timer-driven integration and are comfortable with a small constant idle-CPU cost. Appropriate for tools and utilities where absolute animation fidelity isn't a priority.

## Reactive event-driven loop _(aka the Caped crusader)_

The recommended integration for Views-mode deployments. Instead of a fixed timer, the host registers a scheduler callback via Kurogane's `App::scheduler`. Chromium calls this callback whenever it has computed a deadline for its next required pump, derived from its internal [`base::MessageLoop`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:base/message_loop/message_loop.h) timer queue. The host converts this deadline into a [`ControlFlow::WaitUntil`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/enum.ControlFlow.html#variant.WaitUntil), allowing winit to sleep until either a native OS event or a Chromium-requested wakeup occurs, whichever comes first.

```rust
App::builder()
    .scheduler(|delay: Option<Duration>| {
        // delay is None when Chromium requests an immediate pump
        // Post a wakeup to the winit event loop proxy
        event_loop_proxy
            .send_event(AppEvent::PumpScheduled(delay))
            .ok();
    })
    .build()
```

```rust
// In the winit event handler:
Event::UserEvent(AppEvent::PumpScheduled(delay)) => {
    let deadline = Instant::now() + delay.unwrap_or(Duration::ZERO);
    *control_flow = ControlFlow::WaitUntil(deadline);
}
Event::MainEventsCleared => {
    handle.pump();
}
```

* **Cadence:** Purely reactive. Driven by [`CefApp::OnScheduleMessagePumpWork`](https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/docs/108.4/classCefBrowserProcessHandler.html#a7ff7d1618399ede096ba16486a71d76e) via Kurogane's `App::scheduler`. Chromium explicitly requests a pump from the browser-process UI thread only when delayed tasks or internal work are pending.
* **CPU profile:** Near-zero idle overhead. The host event loop sleeps indefinitely via [`ControlFlow::Wait`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/enum.ControlFlow.html#variant.Wait) until awakened by an OS event or a Kurogane schedule request.
* **Active profile:** Dynamically scales. Automatically matches Chromium's internal work frequency (typically matching `requestAnimationFrame` up to ~60Hz or monitor refresh rate for rAF-driven content).
* **Threading Contract:** Kurogane's `App::scheduler` callback executes on the Chromium UI thread. Crossing this boundary requires [`EventLoopProxy::send_event`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/struct.EventLoopProxy.html) to thread-safely wake the `winit` event loop.

**Use when:** building a production application where resource optimization, battery life and frame-accurate animation fidelity are critical. This follows the external-message-pump architecture recommended for host-managed event loops in Chromium's own [documentation on external message pumps](https://chromiumembedded.github.io/cef/general_usage#message-loop-integration).

## Host-managed native window embedding _(aka the Mad scientist)_

The embedded integration inverts the Views ownership model. The host application creates a native OS window via winit, then attaches a Chromium browser as a child window using [`CefWindowInfo::SetAsChild`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/CefWindowInfo.html). The host retains complete ownership of the top-level window and is responsible for resizing and positioning the child browser surface.

```rust
let mut window_info = CefWindowInfo::new();
window_info.set_as_child(parent_hwnd, CefRect { x: 0, y: 0, width, height });

host.create_browser(
    &window_info,
    client.clone(),
    url,
    &browser_settings,
    None,
    None,
);
```

- **Cadence & CPU:** Reactive (identical to reactive event-driven loop). Driven by Kurogane's `App::scheduler` callbacks. Wakes on demand, near-zero idle CPU.
- **Window hierarchy:** The host process owns the window hierarchy. Chromium renders into a raw child surface (`HWND` / `NSView` / `XWindow`) of the `winit` window's native handle.
- **Layout contract:** Resize events must be forwarded to the browser via [`CefBrowserHost::WasResized`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/CefBrowserHost.html#WasResized()), which signals the renderer process to re-layout. Failure to call this will leave the browser surface clipped or stretched.

Because the host process owns the root window, teardown requires a coordinated multi-step asynchronous dance across the host thread and Chromium UI thread.

The host must not invoke global Chromium shutdown until all browsers have completed their close sequence.

### Asynchronous shutdown sequence

The shutdown sequence for an embedded browser involves coordination across the browser process UI thread and the renderer process. Initiating shutdown with [`CefBrowserHost::CloseBrowser`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/CefBrowserHost.html#CloseBrowser(bool)) is only the first step.

#### Teardown state machine

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as winit Event loop
    participant H as Host application
    participant C as Chromium UI thread

    W->>H: WindowEvent::CloseRequested
    H->>C: close_all_browsers(true)

    C->>C: Destroy browser internals
    C->>C: OnBeforeClose

    C-->>H: Browser unregistered
    H->>H: browser_count() == 0

    H->>C: shutdown()
    H->>W: event_loop.exit()
```

#### Standard Chromium browser close lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Host as Host application
    participant Chromium as Chromium UI thread

    Host->>Chromium: BrowserHandle::close(false)

    Chromium->>Chromium: DoClose()
    Note right of Chromium: Return false to allow<br/>normal Chromium shutdown

    Chromium->>Chromium: Native window closes
    Chromium->>Chromium: OnBeforeClose()

    Note right of Chromium: Browser removed from registry<br/>ShutdownSignal may be set
```

The correct pattern is to decouple window-close intent from event-loop exit:

```rust
Event::WindowEvent { event: WindowEvent::CloseRequested, .. } => {
    // Do NOT exit the event loop here
    // Request browser closure and let Chromium drive the shutdown sequence
    browser_handle.close(false);
}

Event::UserEvent(AppEvent::BrowserClosed) => {
    // OnBeforeClose has fired; it is now safe to exit
    *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit;
}
```

**Use when:** you need Chromium as a composited component within an existing application UI e.g., rendering a web-based settings panel inside a native game or tool window. This is the most flexible integration but requires the host to correctly implement the asynchronous shutdown protocol end-to-end.

> **Fatal footgun:** Browser shutdown is asynchronous. Calling close_browser() only *initiates* browser teardown sequence. The browser is not actually destroyed until Chromium later dispatches [`OnBeforeClose`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/CefLifeSpanHandler.html#OnBeforeClose) *from within* Kurogane's [`handle.pump()`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/86ce9810bcfa6b3b0d2f9a87f04907be7e799829/kurogane/src/runtime.rs#L491) (which internally executes [`CefDoMessageLoopWork`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/(_globals).html#CefDoMessageLoopWork())), after which the browser is removed from the registry. If you intercept a `CloseRequested` window event and immediately call [`event_loop.exit()`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/struct.EventLoop.html) or drop your window structures, the host stops pumping Chromium, [`OnBeforeClose`](https://magpcss.org/ceforum/apidocs3/projects/(default)/CefLifeSpanHandler.html#OnBeforeClose) never executes and the close sequence cannot complete (the `ShutdownSignal` will never be set).
